The character can fly upwards in differnt directions, shrink and grow, rest, and ealk in all cardinal points.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


I really struggled with the undo method. I had no idea how to undo a method especially without an input. Eventually, I decided to use userinput to my advantage. I asked the user which method they would like to undo and i used to if statements to match it with a specific method that reverse enginered the methods listed in the interface. 


Advice: Write down what you want to do on paper. It really helps to make your ideas less abstract. Use flow diagrams, random drawings, get it down. Also I don't be afraid to rewrite tyour entire code if what you wanted was not intially working.
